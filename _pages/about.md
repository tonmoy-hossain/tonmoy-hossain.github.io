This is Tonmoy Hossain, a fifth-year Ph.D. in CS student and an Endowed Fellow at the University of Virginia. I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the MIA Lab under the supervision of [Miaomiao Zhang](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~mz8rr/index.html). I served as the Co-chair and Graduate Program Representative at UVA CSGSG. My primary research interest lies in Computer Vision, Image Analysis and Causal Inference.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
